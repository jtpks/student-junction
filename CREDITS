Student Junction is an app made by Jahnavi Thejo Prakash, a student at Oakridge International School. This app combines a to-do     tab, a calendar tab, an inspiration tab, and a notes tab. During the pandemic, many students have expressed their concerns about
increased distractions at home. The main purpose of Student Junction is to provide a safe and user-friendly app to eliminate 
procrastination and promote focus amongst its users.
